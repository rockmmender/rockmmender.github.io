The Definition of Machine Learning:

> A computer program is said to learn from experience `E` with respect to some task `T` and some performance measure `P`, if its performance on `T`, as measured by `P`, improves with experience `E`

_by **Tom M. Mitchell**_

Machine learning tasks are typically classified into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the learning "signal" or "feedback" available to a learning system. These are:

1. Supervised learning
  * Classification
  * Regression
2. Unsupervised learning
  - Clustering
  - Density estimation
  - Dimensionality reduction
3. Reinforcement learning

$$c = 2\pi r$$

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

$$\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)e^{-2\pi ix\xi}dx$$

$$E=MC^2$$
